# Little streams playground

Just a demo script to demonstrate basic streams capabilities

## Run

Each option will trigger a different scenario

``` bash
elixir streammem.exs [stream|enum|genserver]
```

## Livebook

If you're a fan of [LiveBook](https://livebook.dev/) as I am, you can just fire up

``` bash
livebook server
```

and load our [livebook](./livebook.livemd) to play around :)
